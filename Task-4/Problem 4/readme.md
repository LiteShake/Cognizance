<h2> Quick Intro : </h2>

- I could've easily converted the int to string and reversed it by slicing [::-1] and converted back to int
- and I could've appended all the digits to a list, and run a reverse loop through it and added the digits.

- So I tried to make a method to use only one datatype "int" all over the program. No lists or strings.
- <i> p.s I just remembered another way of checking for pallindrome without finding the number of digits and using only one loop but I'll just keep this unchanged as it is : ) </i>

- <strong> Although I tried to make the program as efficient as possible I'd strongly recommend using the above two methods for maximum efficiency. </strong>
