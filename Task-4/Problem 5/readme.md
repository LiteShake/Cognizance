- After seeing the pattern I saw that the number of  stars are increasing according to the layer number and 
the number of spaces are decreasing from (layer number - 1) to 0.
- So I put that thing in a for loop and multiplied the string to get repeated string accordingly,
concatenated and printed one by one.
