## PYTHON - EASY LVL


<h2> Some tips before jumping into the Code </h2>

- Hello ! I've added some comments here and there ( *literally everywhere* ) to ease through the code and its inner workings : ) 
- I've added "Quick Intro"s in every solution to give a quick introduction on why and how I coded in a specific way.
- I used functions() for everything because functions() are nice.
