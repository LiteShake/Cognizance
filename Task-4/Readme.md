## PYTHON - EASY LVL

Some tips before jumping into the Repository
- Hello ! I've added some comments here and there ( *literally everywhere* ) to ease through the code and its inner workings : ) 
- I've added "Quick Intro"s in every solution to give a quick introduction on why and how I coded in a specific way.
- I used functions() for everything because functions() are nice easy to manage and hopefully prevents sphagetti code.
