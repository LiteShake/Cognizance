# <strong>Stella</strong> : An Intelligent Discord Bot

Intelligent Discord for fun and server moderation.

Stella is a discord bot created by me and a group of friends primarily to have fun using [python](https://www.python.org/).

## <u>Why we made Stella ?</u>

<p>
On June 2021, Inspired by some Discord bots me and my friends decided to create our own Discord bots. I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence very much. So I planned to undertake an A.I Discord bot project.

After seeing many discord bots I felt like they are just, you know .. bots. They respond to commands and respond. I wanted to create a chatbot that mingles with everyone, play games, make jokes, have fun etc just like a normal human.

## <u> Current State </u>

The current version is running in a [replit](https://replit.com/) server and has many fun features but A.I features are not that much implemented yet. One can ask questions and get random answers, play minigames like tic-tac-toe, rock-papar-scissors, connect to a voice channel and play music etc. But most of the features are controlled by a specific algorithm or pre-programmed general instructions.

## <u>Future plans</u>
We are planning to add a Natural Language Processor to our bot so that it can understand what we chat to it and chat accordingly, a Machine Learning model to learn to chat freely and mingle with everyone and a voice-chat voice recognition system.
