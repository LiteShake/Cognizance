## Task 8 Post submission facts :

In [Question5](Question5/Question5.py) The indices where elements of two NumPy arrays are equal can be found easily using the following code...

```
indices = numpy.where( A == B )[0]
```

and in [Question4](Question4/Question4.py) the letters can be capitalized easily by...
```
ser = ser.str.title()
```

.. instead of using the classic looping method which I have used here.
